# **App Name**: EventFlow

## Core Features:

- Event Creation & Management: Allow organizers to create new events, edit event details (name, date, time, location, description, speaker), and manage event status (e.g., draft, published, canceled).
- Attendee Registration: Enable users to register for events, manage their registration status (e.g., confirmed, waitlisted, canceled), and receive event updates. Includes form validation. Uses generative AI as a tool that determines if an attendee registration field may contain PII. If PII may be present, the form will generate an extra disclaimer requiring explicit agreement that PII will be captured.
- Data Export: Enable event organizers to export attendee data (e.g., name, email, registration date) in CSV or other formats.
- Analytics Dashboard: Provide event organizers with a dashboard displaying key event metrics (e.g., number of attendees, registration trends).
- Search and Filtering: Enable attendees to search for events based on keywords, categories, date, and location; allow organizers to filter the events

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Strong purple (#800080), representing sophistication and creativity. It is versatile and contrasts well with lighter backgrounds.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0E6F0), which is subtle and professional but shares the hue of the primary.
- Accent color: A vibrant fuchsia (#FF00FF), standing out boldly while remaining in the purple color family.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look; 'Inter' will be used throughout.
- Use a set of consistent, modern icons for event categories, actions, and navigation. Icons should be simple, geometric, and easily recognizable.
- Maintain a clean, spacious layout with a focus on readability and usability. Utilize white space effectively to create a balanced visual hierarchy.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance user experience. For example, use fade-in effects, smooth scrolling, and animated progress indicators.
